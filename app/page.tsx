      <h1>What is ELI5 to 101?</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to ELI5 to 101, a project born out of simply enjoying the
        simplification of the complex.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a solo endeavor, this is my platform to enjoy and continue breaking
        down intricate topics into understandable nuggets for anyone to grasp.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through ELI5, I emulate those moments when I find myself explaining
        elaborate concepts to newcomers, treating each explanation as if I were
        guiding a curious 5-year-old through the wonders of the world. It's not
        just about making things easy to understand; it's also a personal
        journey of validation and growth. Each explanation I offer here serves
        as a litmus test for my own understanding, ensuring that I've truly
        mastered the material before sharing it with others.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the 101 section, I am targeting my colleagues and attempt to
        elevate the conversation slightly. The target is something like a single
        lecture in a 100 level course about a much broader topic. The goal isn't
        to become experts with a reading, and this project isn't just about
        simplifying; it's about fostering comprehension and confidence in
        decision makers and anyone else who desires to understand.
        <br />
        <br />
        So come along, join me on this journey from simplicity to depth, where
        every explanation is an opportunity for both learning and teaching.
